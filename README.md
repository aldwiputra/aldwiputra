![banner](/images/banner.png)

I am a **Software Engineer** 💻 based in **Bandung, Indonesia**. I started learning software development out of curiosity and immediately realized this field is something I want to do for the rest of my life. Not only that, learning new things has taught me more than the hard skill itself, it has also instilled the [growth mindset](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-is-growth-mindset-8-steps-develop-one1904.html) 📈 in me.
